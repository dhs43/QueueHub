# QueueHub 
QueueHub is an Android app for interactive music queues.

Users can choose to create a session or join an existing one. They can add local music files to the queue. By default, only the user that created the queue will play music from their device. A user that joins can also choose to "Tune In" and play the music from their device as well. This is ideal when users are contributing to the same queue, but are not in the same physical location to listen together.
